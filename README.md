# UI

## Setup Page

We're allowing users to choose from a set of available databases. For each of the below option, design a different page (ex Setup-AWS, Setup-Mongo). They should be like a form-input.
To choose one of "AWS DynamboDB" and "MongoDB / SQL", implement a horizontal bar with the two options to switch views based on the option selected

### AWS DynamboDB

- AWS Access Key Id
- AWS Secret Key
- AWS Region

### MongoDB / SQL

- Connection String

## Home Page

- Display the diary entries with Name, Metadata (Time added etc) in an organised layout (your choice), add pagination if using grids

## View Page

- Display an entry's content, the content will be markdown-compatible
- Title, Metadata should be displayed too
- A button to go back to home page

## New Entry Page

- A markdown-compatible editor with a toolbar for markdown-buttons such as "Bold", "Italic", "Underline"
- A title input bar
